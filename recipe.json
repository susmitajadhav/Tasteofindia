Transfer into a mixing bowl.\nAdd yogurt to another bowl and add the ingredients listed under the mutton marinade. Mix well and add it to the mutton and mix well again. Add coriander leaves + mint. Add fried onions if using storebought or add it later when you are about to cook the meat. Cover and keep this aside from 1 hour to 12 hours. (If longer than an hour, place in the refrigerator)\nPro Tip: \nIf you are in a hurry, you can also marinate for 1 hour, but the longer your marinate, the flavor gets it, and the meat becomes tender. (If you are making biryani for dinner, marinate in the morning, and if you are preparing for the afternoon, marinate the previous night.)\nSOAK RICE:\nWash and soak the rice for 30 minutes to an hour.\nMeanwhile, gather the ingredients needed for assembly and for cooking rice in separate plates for ease.\nFOR FRYING CASHEWS AND ONIONS:\nPlace a dutch oven or a large non-stick pot big enough to hold the mutton and rice on medium-high heat. Add 1/8 cup oil + 2 tablespoons ghee in a pan.\nFry the cashews till golden brown and keep aside. After that, add the onions to the same pan and fry on medium heat till golden brown and crisp. Drain and keep aside and reserve the oil to make biryani.\nTO COOK MUTTON:\nAdd the marinated meat. (add 3/4 cup fried onions if you did not add during the marination process) Stir and let it cook till 75 % done and till oil is seen on top. Taste and adjust the salt if necessary.\nTO COOK RICE:\nWhile the meat is cooking, bring 6 cups of water to a boil. Add salt as needed (When you taste the water the salt should be slightly more than what you usually need).\nAdd all the ingredients mentioned in TO COOK RICE to the water, and then add the soaked and drained rice and let the water come to a boil. Taste and adjust the flavor of the water as needed. Salt should be slightly more than what you normally have.\nReduce the heat and stir the rice and cook it only till only half-cooked (When you take a bite you will feel it will be underdone in the center. It is a crucial step or else the rice will be mushy.\nDrain the rice in a colander and reserve 1/2 cup of water.\nASSEMBLY:\nTo the partially cooked mutton, add 1/2 of the cooked rice and half of the fried onions + coriander leaves + mint leaves. Add the remaining rice and fried onions + coriander leaves + mint leaves + 2 green chilly. sprinkle reserved rice water on top followed by saffron milk. Sprinkle a few drops of food color if using.\nAdd a tablespoon of ghee and fried cashews.\nThere are three ways you can cover. 1.

Place the lid and keep something heavy on the top so that the steam does not escape.\nPlace a girdle or pan on the stove and transfer the biryani pot on top. Reduce the heat to minimum and let it cook for 40 to 50 minutes.\nTo check for doneness, open the lid and slide a laddle along the side of the pan and scoop out the meat.

Mix, shaak is ready.\nLet’s check the khichdi: Stir it a couple of times to mix and as you stir, the rice grain will break and become mushy. You’ll get the perfect porridge consistency. Serve khichdi shaak hot/warm.\nNOTE: Gujarati Khichdi will start to thicken as it cools down.

Grab a fan if you have one. Peel any leaves from the top of the eggplant to prevent them from burning. Brush the eggplant with a bit of oil using a pastry brush or your hands, just a light coating.\nTurn a gas burner on your stove to medium-low heat. Use tongs to hold the eggplant upright (vertically) and hold the bottom of the eggplant over the flame for 3 to 6 minutes to char the bottom, or until a paring knife can pierce the bottom without too much resistance.\nFlip the eggplant 180º and use tongs to char the top of the eggplant for 2 to 3 minutes, but make sure the stem doesn’t directly touch the flame to avoid burning.\nPlace the eggplant onto its side (lying flat, horizontally) and rest it directly on top of the flame, positioning the fatter bottom part directly over the flame. Gently rotate the eggplant every 2 minutes.\nOnce deeply charred and very wrinkly, insert a paring knife into the fattest part: if the knife slides in easily and there is minimal resistance, the bottom is done. If your eggplant was soft/ripe to begin with, it might take 8 minutes. If not, it can take 16 minutes.\nNow insert a paring knife into the skinnier top part part. If it has no resistance, the eggplant is done. If there is a bit of resistance, cook for 4 to 6 minutes, rotating every 2 minutes, until charred and wrinkly.\nNote: as the eggplant cooks, it might sizzle a bit and some juice might escape onto your stove. This is normal.\nTurn off the heat and use tongs to transfer the eggplant to a bowl. Cover with a plate to steam for 5 minutes. Use your hands to peel off the charred papery black flakes. Dip your hands in water to make it easier to peel. It's okay if tiny little black spots remain.\nSlice off the head of the peeled eggplant. Using a knife, flat ended spatula, or potato masher, mash the flesh of the eggplant, as if you were mincing garlic.\nNote: If your eggplant was ripe/soft to begin with, it's possible the cooked eggplant will be quite watery. If that's the case, add it to a fine mesh sieve and push down on it with a spoon to squeeze out as much excess water as you can.\nMake the bharta. Heat the 1 1/2 TBSP oil in a medium frying pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add cumin seeds and cook for 1 minute, tossing or swirling frequently to prevent burning. Add the onions with a pinch of salt and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, but don’t let them brown. Add the garlic, ginger, serrano peppers, and turmeric, and cook, stirring frequently for 60 to 90 seconds. Add the coriander, salt, and tomatoes, and cook until the oil starts to release from the tomatoes and the tomatoes are soft, about 5 minutes.\nAdd in the mashed eggplant mixture and red chile powder and toss well to combine. Reduce the heat to medium or medium-low and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, stirring often and mashing together. Add in the garam masala and chopped cilantro and season with ¼ teaspoon kosher salt. Serve warm with bread or rice of choice.","Total Cook Time":"40min","Prep Time":"10min","Cook Time":"30min","Setting Time":"10 min","Soaking Time":"No","Resting Time":"10min","Serves":"2","Taste":"Pungent","Color":"chilli Red","Course":"Lunch , Dinner","Meals":"Veg , vegan","Difficulties":2,"State":"Punjab","Video Link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2YmddYMDieI","Cooking Type":"Regular(30min)","Cuisine":"NorthIndian","Occasion":" Diwali ","Drinks":"No","Sugar/SugarFree":"SugarFree","RecipeName":"Baigan Bharta","Ingredients":"1) 1 medium-sized eggplant (about 1 pound, or 450g).\n    2) Grapeseed oil or avocado oil (or neutral-flavored oil of choice).\n    3) 1 ½ Tablespoons neutral-flavored oil of choice.\n    4) 1 Teaspoon cumin seeds.\n    5) 1 medium red (or yellow) onion, finely diced.\n    6) 4 garlic cloves, finely chopped.\n    7) 1-inch piece ginger, grated (or minced).\n    8) 1 small serrano pepper, finely chopped (optional for spicy!; omit for moderate heat).\n    9) ½ Teaspoon ground turmeric.\n    10) 1 Teaspoon ground coriander.\n    11) 1 ½ Teaspoons kosher salt.\n    12) 2 medium plum or roma tomatoes, finely chopped.\n    13) ½ Teaspoon kashmiri red chile powder.\n    14) 1 Teaspoon garam masala.\n    15) 1 Cup (16g) cilantro leaves and tender stems, chopped.","Category":"easy","ImagesSource":"https://rainbowplantlife.com/baingan-bharta/","IngredientsSource":"https://rainbowplantlife.com/baingan-bharta/","ProcessSource":"https://rainbowplantlife.com/baingan-bharta/"}

This soaking period is your window to get all other ingredients lined up and ready.\nHandling: Once soaked, ensure the Gundruk has cooled to a touch-friendly temperature. Press firmly to wring out the water, then proceed to chop any large pieces into manageable, bite-size chunks, about 3-5 cm each, for even cooking and texture.\nSauté the Aromatics:\nStart by heating up the oil. Choose a deep skillet or pan and heat the vegetable oil over a medium flame.\nCarefully add the chopped onions, stirring occasionally, until they turn a beautiful golden brown, releasing their sweet, aromatic essence.\nIntroduce the garlic slices next, frying until golden and just before they turn brown, to infuse the oil.\nAdd the dry spices—turmeric powder, coriander powder—stirring vigorously to prevent them from sticking to the pan and ensuring they release their full spectrum of flavors.\nCooking the Vegetables:\nAdd the diced potatoes, giving them a brief fry to initiate softening, ensuring they're well coated with the spiced oil.\nFold in the pre-soaked Gundruk and the chopped green chilies, mixing thoroughly for 1-2 minutes.\nFold in the diced tomatoes and salt. You might need to cover the pan with a lid off and on to help the tomatoes break down and soften.\nAfter the tomato has softened, pour in 1 liter of water (including the liquid remaining from the soaked Gundruk) and bring the mix to a gentle boil. Then, reduce to a simmer, covering the pan, and let it bubble away for about 10 minutes on low to medium heat.\nAdd the final touches:\nAs the final step, squeeze in the juice of a fresh lemon to brighten the flavors, then turn off the heat. Sprinkle freshly chopped coriander leaves over the top, lending a vibrant color and a fresh, herbal note to the soup.","Total Cook Time":"35 min","Prep Time":"20 min","Cook Time":" 15 min","Setting Time":"2-3days","Soaking Time":"No","Resting Time":"No","Serves":"2/4","Taste":"Sour, Pungent","Color":"Dark Brown","Meals":"veg,Vegan","Difficulties":1,"Drinks":"No","Occasion":"Everyday Meals","Sugar/SugarFree":"sugarFree","RecipeName":"Gundruk","Ingredients":"1) 3 Tablespoon Vegetable Oil.\n    2) 100 Gram Gundruk.\n    3) 1 Potato Diced Into Small Chunks.\n    4) 1 Onion Medium-Sized Finely Sliced.\n    5) 1 Tomato Medium-Sized Roughly Chopped.\n    6) 5 Garlic Cloves Finely Sliced.\n    7) 1 Fresh Chilli Finely Chopped.\n    8) ½ Teaspoon Coriander Powder.\n    9) ½ Teaspoon Turmeric Powder.\n    10) 1 Teaspoon Salt.\n    11) Coriander Leaves For Garnishing.\n    12) 2 Tablespoon Lemon Juice.","Cooking Type":"Medium(30 min)","Course":"Lunch,Dinner","Cuisine":"Nepal","ImagesSource":"https://junifoods.com/gundruk-ko-jhol-fermented-mustard-green-soup-%e0%a4%97%e0%a5%81%e0%a4%a8%e0%a5%8d%e0%a4%a6%e0%a5%8d%e0%a4%b0%e0%a5%81%e0%a4%95%e0%a4%95%e0%a4%be%e0%a5%87-%e0%a4%9d%e0%a5%8b%e0%a4%b2/","IngredientsSource":"https://junifoods.com/gundruk-ko-jhol-fermented-mustard-green-soup-%e0%a4%97%e0%a5%81%e0%a4%a8%e0%a5%8d%e0%a4%a6%e0%a5%8d%e0%a4%b0%e0%a5%81%e0%a4%95%e0%a4%95%e0%a4%be%e0%a5%87-%e0%a4%9d%e0%a5%8b%e0%a4%b2/","ProcessSource":"https://junifoods.com/gundruk-ko-jhol-fermented-mustard-green-soup-%e0%a4%97%e0%a5%81%e0%a4%a8%e0%a5%8d%e0%a4%a6%e0%a5%8d%e0%a4%b0%e0%a5%81%e0%a4%95%e0%a4%95%e0%a4%be%e0%a5%87-%e0%a4%9d%e0%a5%8b%e0%a4%b2/"}

Depending on the thickness and size of frying vessel, the flame should be adjusted. Once when it fries and firms up a bit you can flip it on the other side with the help of skewer or chopstick. Fry till it turns golden brown in colour. The sel roti should be crispy from outside and soft inside.

Place a pot of water on medium-high heat. Once it heats up a bit, add the potatoes to it and let the water come to a boil.\nWhen the water comes to a full boil (it will take some time), turn off heat, cover the pan with a plate and let it remain like that for 15 minutes.\nThis will cook the potatoes just right and they will not be over-cooked.\nThen drain using a strainer and wash the potatoes under cold water. Peel the potatoes, the skin will come off easily.\nUse a toothpick to prick the potatoes all over, do this with all the potatoes and then set them aside.\nNow let's roast and grind the spices. Place the whole spices- 1 tablespoon coriander seeds, 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds, 4 green cardamoms, 2 cloves and 1-inch cinnamon stick into a small pan on medium heat.\nRoast the spices for 2 to 3 minutes until fragrant, be careful not to burn them. Then let them cool down a bit and then transfer to a spice grinder and grind to a fine powder. Set aside.\nHeat 2 teaspoons mustard oil in a pan (make sure mustard oil is well heated before adding anything to it else it will have the raw taste). Once hot,  add ginger, garlic and green chili and cook for 1 minute.\nThen add the onions and cashews and cook for 3 minutes until onions soften.\nRemove pan from heat, transfer onion mixture to a blender and blend to a fine paste. Set it aside.\nNow heat 4 tablespoons of mustard oil in a kadai/work on medium heat (again make sure mustard oil is really hot before you add anything to it else it will have the raw smell). Add the boiled potatoes and fry them until golden brown from both sides.\nOnce golden brown from both sides, remove the fried potatoes on a plate. Once they cool down a little, prick them again with toothpick.\nTo the same oil, now add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds and 1 bay leaf. Saute few seconds and then add 1/2 teaspoon hing.\nThen add 1 teaspoon kashmiri red chili powder and fry for few seconds so that it gets a nice red color.\nAdd the prepared onion-cashew paste and mix well. Cook for 2 minutes.\nThen add the ground spices (that we had grind earlier) along with 1/4 teaspoon black pepper and mix well and cook for 1 minute.\nRemove pan from heat and add the whisked (and room temperature) yogurt to the pan. Stir the yogurt continuously as you mix it with the curry so that it doesn't separate.\nPut pan back on medium heat and continue to stir and let the mixture come to a light boil. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Then add salt, remaining 1/2 teaspoon kashmiri red chili powder and turmeric.\nCook for 4 minutes until you see oil on top of the masala.\nThen add the fried potatoes to the kadai.  Mix well and add 1/4 cup water. Cover with a lid tightly and \"dum\" cook for 5 to 6 minutes on low heat.\nThen add cream, sugar, garam masala, kasuri methi. I added additional 3/4 cup water here.

{"_id":{"$oid":"66f518b3c3052446dd333a15"},"Sr.No":41,"Process":" It's a good idea to make all the fillings in advance- boil the potatoes and dice them, boil the moong dal, boil the chickpeas or use canned chickpeas, prepare the cilantro chutney and sweet tamarind chutney (you can also use store bought).\nAnd in a large bowl whisk together 4 cups of yogurt with 4 teaspoons sugar and 1 teaspoon kala namak. Set it aside.\nTo a bowl add fine sooji, maida, besan, salt and baking powder. Mix using a whisk. Add 2 teaspoons oil.\nAnd then start adding water and knead to form a soft and smooth dough (should not be hard at all as semolina absorbs water as it sits so make the dough a little more on the softer side). Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let rest for 15 minutes.\nMeanwhile heat oil (around 1-2 inches of oil) in a kadai on medium heat (not too hot and not too cold), medium is what you want.\nThen pinch take portion out of the dough (around 45-50 grams ) and roll it between your palms to make a round, then press to flatten it.\nDip pressed dough in little oil (this helps if dough has become little dry and also helps in rolling) and start rolling the kachoris now.\nRoll into a circle and then use a bowl/cookie cutter to trim the edges so that you have clean edges. You should have a circle of around 4 to 5 inches diameter. Now, I like to roll it a little again, just one stroke length wise and one width wise to make sure it's not very thick and all even.\nYou can roll all kachoris at one time and then fry (keep all rolled kachoris covered else dough will dry out).\nAdd one rolled kachoris into the oil.\nAs soon as you drop it, push oil over the top of the kachori which is not dipped in oil with a spatula and also keep pressing the top of the kachori, this will help it in puffing it up.\nKeep pressing the top with a spatula and it will puff up if rolled evenly.\nTurn few times to get it evenly golden from both sides. Then remove fried kachori on a plate and fry all kachoris similarly. Now wait for kachoris to cool.\nNow once it has cooled down, arrange the kachori on a serving plate. Then tap and break the top of the kachoris to make space for the filling.\nAdd around 1/2 tablespoon diced potatoes (4-5 small pieces of diced potatoes) and 1 tablespoon boiled chickpeas. Also crush a papdi and add. Sprinkle chaat masala and cumin powder.\nThen add around 1 tablespoon whisked yogurt, followed by 1 tablespoon boiled moong dal.\nTop with teaspoon of cilantro chutney and teaspoon of sweet tamarind chutney.\nAgain top with 2-3 tablespoons yogurt, followed by more cilantro and sweet chutney. Sprinkle cumin powder, chaat masala, red chili powder on top.\nAnd finally garnish with cilantro, sev and pomegranate. Make all kachoris similarly. You will get around 10 kachoris from this.\nServe raj kachori immediately, as soon as you make them with extra yogurt drizzled on the side.","Total Cook Time":"45 min","Prep Time":" 15 min","Cook Time":"30 min","Setting Time":"No","Soaking Time":"No","Resting Time":" 15-20 min","Serves":"10 ","Taste":"Spicy","Color":"Golden Brown","Course":"Lunch, Brunch, Anytime , Dinner","Meals":"Veg","Difficulties":"2","State":"Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh","Video Link":"","Cooking Type":"Slow(1 hr)","Cuisine":"Rajasthani","Occasion":"Diwali","Drinks":"No","Sugar/SugarFree":"SugarFree","RecipeName":"Kachori","Images":"https://www.cookwithmanali.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Raj-Kachori.jpg","Ingredients":"For Kachori:\n1) 1 cup fine sooji 165 grams, fine semolina.\n  2) 1 tablespoon all purpose flour 11 grams.\n  3) 3 tablespoons besan 33 grams, gram flour.\n  4) 1/4 teaspoon salt.\n  5) 1/4 teaspoon baking powder.\n  6) 2 teaspoons oil 10 ml.\n  7) Water to knead the dough, 1/3 to 1/2 cup.\nFor Yogurt:\n 1) 4 cups whole milk yogurt plain, 960 grams.\n  2) 4 teaspoons sugar.\n  3) 1 teaspoon kala namak black salt.\nFor filling:\n 1) 2 medium potatoes boiled and diced.\n  2) 1 cup chickpeas boiled.\n  3) 10-15 papdi.\n  4) 1 cup green moong dal boiled.\n  5) cumin powder.\n  6) chaat masala.\n  7) cilantro chutney.\n  8) sweet tamarind chutney.\n  9) kashmiri red chili powder to garnish.\n  10) chopped cilantro to garnish.\n  11) sev to garnish.\n  12) pomegranate arils to garnish.\n","Category":"Thela, Spicy, ","ImagesSource":"https://www.cookwithmanali.com/raj-kachori/","IngredientsSource":"https://www.cookwithmanali.com/raj-kachori/","ProcessSource":"https://www.cookwithmanali.com/raj-kachori/"}

Set aside.\nCombine the spices and salt in a small bowl and set aside.\nStovetop Method:\nHeat oil in a non-stick dutch oven over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the onion and sauté, stirring occasionally, until it turns golden brown, about 6 minutes. Deglaze the pan with 2 tbsp of water.\nOnce the water dries up, add the garlic and ginger and continue to sauté for 1-2 minutes, until the raw smell disappears. Add the spices and salt and sauté for 15 seconds, then pour in the yogurt mixture. Bring this mixture to a boil, stirring often.\nOnce the mixture starts to reach a boil (this will take around 6 minutes), lower the heat to medium-low so that it simmers. Partially cover with the lid, and allow it to simmer for 1 hours and 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. Scrape the sides of the pot as needed. If the mixture thickens too much, stir in 1/4-1/2 cup (preferably boiling) water.\nOnce the oil rises to the top and the mixture no longer has any raw taste, turn the heat to the lowest setting and allow it to simmer while you prepare the pakoras.\nInstant Pot Method:\nSelect the Sauté – More/High setting on the Instant Pot. Once hot, add the oil and chopped onion. Sauté, stirring occasionally, until the onion turns golden brown, about 6 minutes. Deglaze the pan with 2 tbsp of water.\nOnce the water dries up, add the garlic and ginger and continue to sauté for 1-2 minutes, until the raw smell disappears. Add the spices and salt sauté for 15 seconds, then pour in the yogurt mixture. Bring this mixture to a boil, stirring often.\nOnce the mixture reaches a boil (this will take around 6 minutes), press the Cancel button to turn off the Instant Pot. Secure the lid and set the Pressure Release to Sealing. Select the Pressure Cook setting and set it to low pressure. Set the cooking time for 30 minutes.\nAllow the pressure to naturally release for 10 minutes. Manually release pressure by moving the Pressure Release to Venting. Stir to mix. If you'd like it thicker, select Saute – Normal and reduce down to desired consistency.\nTo Prepare Pakoras:\nMeanwhile, prepare the pakora mixture. In a small bowl, combine the ingredients listed under Pakora except water and oil in the order they're listed. Add water, bit by bit, until the mixture is coated but not runny. Set aside. The vegetables will release their own juices and the mixture will become thinner.\nHeat a small frying pan or heavy-bottomed pot over high heat. Add oil so that it’s at least 3/4”/1.9 cm deep. Once the oil is hot, adjust heat level as needed to maintain medium-high heat (around 320°F/160°C).\nGently lower in the pakora mixture a tablespoon at a time, making sure not to overcrowd the pan (I do 4-5 at a time). Fry for 3-4 minutes on each side, until golden and crisp. Use a slotted spoon to remove and place on a paper-towel lined plate. Repeat until all pakoras are cooked, adding oil if needed.\nAfter Cooking the Kadhi:\nTaste and adjust salt. Turn off the heat and stir in vinegar or lemon juice.\nAdd cooked pakoras to the Kadhi and stir gently. Remove from the Instant Pot and place in a serving bowl.\nTarka (Tempering):\nHeat ghee or oil in a small sauté pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the whole red chilis and cumin seeds. Sauté for about 15 seconds, until the red chili peppers begin to darken and the cumin seeds sizzle and lightly toast.\nRemove from heat and gently pour the oil over the kadhi. Sprinkle with cilantro.

You can also add veggies of your choice.\nAdd all the above chopped veggies in a 2 litre pressure cooker. Also add 1 cup green peas (fresh or frozen).\nAdd 2.25 to 2.5 cups water.\nPressure cook the veggies for 5 to 6 whistles or for about 12 minutes on medium flame.\nWhen the pressure settles down on its own, open the cooker and check if the veggies are cooked well. You can even steam or cook the veggies in a pan. The vegetables have be to cooked completely.\nSautéing onions:\nHeat a pan or kadai. You can also use a large tawa. Add 2 to 3 tablespoons butter. You can use amul butter or any brand of butter. Butter can be salted or unsalted.\nAs soon as the butter melts, add 1 teaspoon cumin seeds.\nLet the cumin seeds crackle and change their color.\nThen add ½ cup finely chopped onions.\nMix onions with the butter and saute on a low to medium flame till the onions translucent.\nThen add 2 teaspoons ginger-garlic paste.

This takes about 6 to 7 minutes on a low to medium flame. If the tomatoes start sticking to the pan, then sprinkle some water and mix well.\nWhen the tomatoes have softened, then add ½ cup finely chopped capsicum (green bell pepper). Sauté for 2 to 3 minutes. If the mixture starts sticking to the pan, then you can sprinkle some water. You don’t need to cook the capsicum till very soft. A little crunch is alright.\nSautéing ground spices:\nAdd 1 teaspoon turmeric powder and 1 teaspoon kashmiri red chilli powder.\nThen add 2 to 3 tablespoons pav bhaji masala. mix very well.\nAdding cooked vegetables:\nAdd the cooked veggies. Add all of the stock or water from the pressure cooker in which the veggies were cooked. Mix very well.\nThen season with salt as per taste.\nWith a potato masher, begin to mash the veggies directly in the pan.\nYou can mash the veggies less or more according to the consistency you want. For a smooth mixture mash more. For a chunky pav bhaji, mash less.\nKeep on stirring occasionally and let the bhaji simmer for 8 to 10 minutes. \nIf the bhaji looks dry and then add some more water. The consistency is neither very thick nor thin.\nDo stir often so that the bhaji does not stick to the pan. When the pav bhaji simmers to the desired consistency, check the taste. Add salt, pav bhaji masala, red chili powder or butter if required.\nWhen the bhaji is simmering, you can fry the pav so that you serve the pav with hot bhaji. Slice the pavs.\nMaking Instant Pot Pav Bhaji:\nSwitch on the instant pot. Press the sauté button on less mode. Add 2 tablespoons butter in the ip steel insert.\nWhen the butter melts, add cumin seeds and let them splutter and change color. Then add finely chopped onions and sauté onions till they soften.\nNext add the ginger-garlic paste and green chillies.

Now press the pressure cooker/manual button and set time to 7 minutes on high pressure.\nWhen the beep sound is heard and the pressure cooking is complete, do a quick pressure release (qpr). When all the pressure is released, open the lid. \nUsing a napkin or oven mittens, remove the steel insert from the instant pot. Place it on your kitchen counter.\nWith a potato masher, begin to mash the cooked vegetables. Mash very well. You can even use an immersion blender and puree the veggies.

Press the cancel button and then press the sauté button on normal mode. Set the timer to 3 to 5 minutes or more.\nSimmer the bhaji for a few minutes, till it thickens a bit and you get the desired consistency. Stir often, so that the bhaji does not stick to the bottom. If the bhaji looks very thick, then add some water.\nSprinkle 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves. Mix very well. Do check the taste and add salt, butter, kashmiri red chili powder or pav bhaji masala if required. Cancel and keep the IP on warm mode.\nToasting pav (dinner rolls):\nHeat a skillet or a shallow frying pan.

You can skip pav bhaji masala if you want.\nMix the pav bhaji masala very well with a spoon or spatula.\nThen place the pav on the butter.\nRotate the pav all over the melted butter so that the pav absorbs the butter.\nNow turn over the pav and rotate them on the tawa so that the second side absorbs the butter. Add more butter if required.\nYou can turn over and toast them more if required. Then remove in a plate and keep aside.","Total Cook Time":"40 min","Prep Time":"20-30 min","Cook Time":"20 min","Setting Time":"15-20 min","Soaking Time":"No","Resting Time":"30 min","Serves":"4/6","Taste":"Crispy","Color":"Golden brown","Course":"Breakfast,Anytime","Meals":"Veg","Difficulties":"2","State":"North Indian","Video Link":"","Cooking Type":"Slow(1hour)","Cuisine":"NorthIndian","Occasion":"Diwali,Bithday","Drinks":"No","Sugar/SugarFree":"SugarFree","RecipeName":"Pav Bhaji ","Ingredients":"  For making bhaji vegetable gravy: \n    1) 3 Potatoes (Medium-Sized) – 250 Grams.\n    2) 1 To 1.25 Cups Chopped Cauliflower – 120 To 130 Grams.\n    3) 1 Cup Chopped Carrot.\n    4) 1 Cup Green Peas – Fresh Or Frozen.\n    5) ⅓ Cup Chopped French Beans – 12 To 14 French Beans – Optional.\n    6) 2.25 To 2.5 Cups Water – For Pressure Cooking Veggies.\n  Other ingredients: \n    7) 3 Tablespoons Butter – Salted Or Unsalted.\n    8) 1 Teaspoon Cumin Seeds.\n    9) ½ Cup Finely Chopped Onion Or 1 Medium To Large Onion.\n    10) 2 Teaspoons Ginger Garlic Paste Or 1.5 Inch Ginger & 5 To 6 Medium Garlic Cloves Crushed In A Mortar.\n    11) 1 Teaspoon Chopped Green Chilies Or Serrano Peppers Or 1 To 2 Green Chilies.\n    12) ½ Cup Finely Chopped Capsicum Or 1 Medium Sized Capsicum (Green Bell Pepper).\n    13) 2 Cups Finely Chopped Tomatoes (Tightly Packed) Or About 2 To 3 Large Tomatoes.\n    14) 1 Teaspoon Turmeric Powder (Ground Turmeric).\n    15) 1 Teaspoon Kashmiri Chilli Powder Or Freshly Ground 3 To 4 Soaked Dry Kashmiri Red Chilies.\n    16) 2 To 3 Tablespoons Pav Bhaji Masala – Add As Required.\n    17) 1.5 To 2 Cups Water Or The Stock In Which The Veggies Were Cooked, Add As Needed.\n    18) Salt As Required.\n  For Instant Pot Pav Bhaji: \n    19) 2 To 3 Tablespoons Butter – Salted Or Unsalted.\n    20) ½ Teaspoon Cumin Seeds.\n    21) ½ Cup Finely Chopped Onions Or 1 Medium To Large Onion – 50 To 60 Grams.\n    22) 2 Teaspoons Ginger Garlic Paste Or 1.5 Inch Ginger & 5 To 6 Medium Garlic Cloves Crushed In A Mortar.\n    23) 1 Teaspoon Chopped Green Chilies Or Serrano Peppers Or 1 To 2 Green Chilies.\n    24) 2 Cups Chopped Tomatoes Or 3 Large Tomatoes – 300 Grams.\n    25) ⅓ Cup Chopped Capsicum (Green Bell Pepper).\n    26) 2 Cups Chopped Potatoes Or 3 Medium Or 2 Large Potatoes – 250 Grams.\n    27) ¾ To 1 Cup Chopped Cauliflower – 100 Grams.\n    28) ¾ Cup Chopped Carrots Or 1 Medium To Large Carrot – 100 Grams.\n    29) ¼ Cup Chopped French Beans – Optional.\n    30) ½ Cup Green Peas – Fresh Or Frozen.\n    31) ½ Teaspoon Turmeric Powder.\n    32) 1 To 1.5 Teaspoons Kashmiri Red Chilli Powder Or ½ To 1 Teaspoon Cayenne Pepper Or Paprika.\n    33) 1.25 Cups Water.\n    34) Salt As Required.\n    35) 2 Tablespoons Pav Bhaji Masala.\n    36) 1 To 2 Tablespoons Butter – To Be Added Later.\n    37) 2 Tablespoons Coriander Leaves (Cilantro).\n  Accompaniments: \n    38) 12 Pav (Dinner Rolls) Or As Required.\n    39) 3 To 4 Tablespoons Butter – For Roasting Pav.\n    40) 1 Lemon Or Lime, Chopped In Wedges.\n    41) 1 Onion – Medium To Large, Finely Chopped.\n    42) 3 To 4 Tablespoons Chopped Coriander Leaves – For Garnish.\n    43) 2 To 3 Tablespoons Butter – For Topping – Add More For A Richer Version.","Images":"https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/pav-bhaji-1-1111x1536.jpg","ImagesSource":"https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/pav-bhaji-recipe-mumbai-pav-bhaji-a-fastfood-recipe-from-mumbai/","IngredientsSource":"https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/pav-bhaji-recipe-mumbai-pav-bhaji-a-fastfood-recipe-from-mumbai/","ProcessSource":"https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/pav-bhaji-recipe-mumbai-pav-bhaji-a-fastfood-recipe-from-mumbai/"}

Mix well using a wire whisk.\nThen add 3 tablespoons plain yogurt and 2 tablespoons oil. Mix until all the oil and yogurt is well incorporated with the flour. Rub the flour with your fingers until it's all mixed well.\nNow, start adding water little by little and knead to form a smooth dough. It should be a soft dough but not too soft, it should be little firm. I used around 1/2 cup + 1 to 2 tablespoons water here, use as much as you need.\nDrizzle little oil on top, give a final knead. Cover with a damp cloth and rest for 30 to 45 minutes.\nAfter the dough has rested, divide it into 8 equal parts, around 60 to 65 grams each.\nHeat a concave iron tawa or an iron mini wok (I have used a 9-inch lodge mini wok which works perfectly for tandoori rotis) on medium-high heat. Now, take a dough ball, dust with dry flour and roll into a circle of around 5 to 6 inches diameter. You should roll it on the thicker side, it doesn't have to be thin like a normal roti.\nNow, generously wet one side of the rolled roti with water. Use water liberally here since we need enough water for the roti to stick well to the pan.\nOnce the work (or tawa) is hot (it needs to hot and not medium hot), place the rolled roti with the wet side down on the wok/tawa. Since you applied water, the roti from that side will stick to the wok.\nNow let it cook for 20 to 30 seconds on high heat. You will see lot of bubbles appearing on top.\nNow carefully flip the wok (I wear gloves since this is cast iron) and cook the roti directly on heat with the wok being upside down. Heat should be medium at this point and you should move the wok a little bit so that it gets cooked evenly from everywhere.\nOnce the rotis have brown spots all over, flip the wok back and remove the roti from the wok using a spatula.\nApply ghee on roti. Make all rotis similarly. You will notice some rotis might be stuck, remove them carefully using a spatula. And there will be some browned bits from the sticking, just scrape that off using a damp paper before you put the next roti on the wok/tawa.\nServe hot with creamy curries or dal.","Total Cook Time":"45 min","Prep Time":"15 min","Cook Time":"30 min","Setting Time":"30 min","Soaking Time":"No","Resting Time":" 30 min","Serves":"4/6","Taste":"Soft with slight smoky flavor","Color":"Golden brown","Course":"Lunch, Brunch, Anytime, Dinner","Meals":"veg","Difficulties":"1","State":"Punjab","Video Link":"https://youtu.be/LmlS6tsI_ug?si=mVC5v3L_96V6qIMg","Cooking Type":"Regular(30min)","Cuisine":"NorthIndian","Occasion":"Weddings","Drinks":"No","Sugar/SugarFree":"SugarFree","RecipeName":"Tandoori Roti","Images":"https://www.cookwithmanali.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Tandoori-Roti-676x1024.jpg","Ingredients":" 1) 2 Cups Atta 270 Grams, Durum Whole Wheat Flour, I Used Sujata Gold Brand.\n    2) ¾ Teaspoon Salt Or To Taste.\n    3) ½ Teaspoon Sugar.\n    4) ¾ Teaspoon Baking Powder.\n    5) Generous Pinch Baking Soda.\n    6) 3 Tablespoons Yogurt Plain Yogurt.\n    7) 2 Tablespoons Oil.\n    8) Water To Knead, Around ½ Cup + 1-2 Tablespoons.\n    9) Ghee To Brush The Rotis.","ImagesSource":"https://www.cookwithmanali.com/tandoori-roti/","IngredientsSource":"https://www.cookwithmanali.com/tandoori-roti/","ProcessSource":"https://www.cookwithmanali.com/tandoori-roti/"}

This should take a two or three minutes.\nLet cool and grind to a fine powder. I like a coffee grinder for this. The old ones with the blade work well. Bad for coffee. Great for spices.\nYou won't need anywhere near all of it so transfer it to a jar with a tight fitting lid and store in a cool, dark place. Use it as a funky peppery garam masala if you like.\nDo your prep\nMeasure out your spice mix. Stem your curry leaves. Prep your chicken. Measure out a cup (237 ml) of Indian hotel curry gravy. Cut up your green chilies. Slice your shallot.\nHave your garlic ginger paste, tamarind and coconut milk handy. You're good to go now.\nMake your tempering :\nHeat 1 tbsp of coconut oil over medium low heat in the same little pan you used to toast the spices.\nAdd the shallots and cook until the shallots start to brown.\nAdd the mustard seed and about 10 curry leaves and cook until the shallots are nicely brown. Set aside.\nMake the kerala chicken curry :\nHeat the oil in a medium sized frying pan until the oil just starts to shimmer.\nStir in the garlic ginger paste. Gently fry until the garlic ginger paste stops sputtering. This can get a little messy.\nTurn your heat down to medium low and add your spice mix and the remaining 5 curry leaves. Cook for about 30 seconds. You want to fry your spices in the oil. Don't skimp on the oil. Bad things happen if the spices stick and burn.\nAdd the green chilies. Cook another 30 seconds or so.\nAdd the Indian hotel curry gravy. Stir it really well to get the oil to combine with the curry gravy. You want everything mixed together at this point. Bring to a simmer.\nAdd the chicken thigh pieces in a single layer. Nestle them down into the sauce. Cover and cook about 5 minutes. Remove the cover, flip the chicken and recover. Cook until the chicken is done. Use an instant read thermometer if you have one. You are shooting for an internal temperature of 160F. It will get to 170F as the curry finishes cooking.\nAdd the tamarind paste and coconut milk. Stir well to combine.\nLook at the consistency. If you are happy with it, cover and simmer for 2 minutes. If it's too thick, add a bit of water and stir to combine. If it's too thin don't cover it to let it reduce.\nWhile the curry is in it's final simmer, warm up the tempering over low heat.\nTransfer the kerala chicken curry to a serving dish and drizzle/sprinkle it with the tempering.\nKerala chicken curry is great with rice and chapatis or parathas.","Total Cook Time":"40min","Prep Time":"20min","Cook Time":"20min","Serves":"2","Taste":"spicy","Color":"chilli red","Course":"Lunch,Dinner","Meals":"NonVeg(chicken)","Difficulties":"3","State":"South Indian","Video Link":"https://youtu.be/XjnyHwWucc4?si=d4h45hRYeMrh5mXs","Cooking Type":"yes","Cuisine":"SouthIndian","Occasion":"Eid and onam","Drinks":"No","RecipeName":"Kerala Chicken Curry","Ingredients":"Kerala Masala :\n    1) 1½ Tbsp Black Peppercorns.\n    2) ½ Tsp Cumin Seed.\n    3) 2 Tbsp Coriander Seed.\n    4) 1 Tsp Fennel Seed.\n    5) 1 Inch Cinnamon Bark (Cassia).\n    6) 1 Star Anise.\n    7) 8 Cloves.\n    8) 8 Green Cardamom Pods.\n  \n  The Spice Mix :\n    1) 2½ Tsp Kerala Masala – The Ground Spice (See Above).\n    2) 1½ Tsp Kashmiri Chili Powder.\n    3) ½ Tsp Kasoor Methi (Dried Fenugreek Leaves).\n    4) ¼ Tsp Turmeric.\n    5) ½ Tsp Kosher Salt.\n  \n  Kerala Chicken Curry :\n    1) 3 Tbsp Coconut Oil – Any Neutral Oil Will Also Work Or Even ½ And ½ Coconut And Neutral Oil.\n    2) 1 Tbsp Garlic Ginger Paste.\n    3) The Spice Mix From Above.\n    4) 2–3 Finger Hot (Jwala) Green Chilies Cut Into 1 Inch Pieces.\n    5) 5 Fresh Curry Leaves.\n    6) 1 Cup Indian Hotel Curry Gravy.\n    7) ½ Tsp Tamarind Paste.\n    8) 3 Boneless, Skinless Chicken Thighs Cut Into 4 Pieces Each.\n    9) 3 Tbsp Coconut Milk.\n  \n  Tempering :\n    1) 1 Tbsp Coconut Oil.\n    2) ½ Tsp Mustard Seeds.\n    3) 10 Fresh Curry Leaves.\n    4) ½ Shallot Thinly Sliced.\n  \n","category":"Curry","Sugar/SugarFree":"SugarFree","ImagesSource":"https://g lebekitchen.com/kerala-chicken-curry-nadan-kohzi-indian-hotel-style/","IngredientSource":" https://glebekitchen.com/kerala-chicken-curry-nadan-kohzi-indian-hotel-style/","ProcessSource":" https://glebekitchen.com/kerala-chicken-curry-nadan-kohzi-indian-hotel-style/"}

Also add ¼ teaspoon salt.\nPour ½ cup water. The water should just about cover the suran cubes.\nIf using plantain (unripe banana), then you can add ¾ cup of cubed plantains along with ¾ cup of cubed yam.\nAdd water just about covering them.\nNow continuing with step 3 – after adding water in the pan, cover the pan with a lid and keep it on a stove top. Cook on low to medium heat till the suran becomes tender and gets cooked. \nDo check at intervals. In case the water dries up and the suran pieces are not cooked, then add some more water. Cover and continue to cook.\nCheck if the yam is cooked by cutting it with a knife or passing a knife through a few cubes. The knife should pass easily.\nGrinding coconut paste and whisking curd.\nMeanwhile whilst the suran is getting cooked, take ½ cup tightly packed fresh grated coconut in a grinder jar. Add 2 to 3 green chilies (chopped) and ½ teaspoon cumin seeds.\nAdd ¼ to ⅓ cup water and grind to a smooth paste and keep aside.\nTake 1 cup sour curd in a bowl and beat it with a spoon or wired whisk till smooth. You can also use fresh curd instead of sour curd.\nMaking kalan curry :\nOnce the yam is cooked and tender, then it is time to add the coconut paste. If there is water in the pan, then evaporate it without the lid. There should be no water in the pan, before you proceed to the next step.\nOr you could opt to strain the cooked yam using a fine strainer, draining all the liquids.\nNow add the ground coconut paste and mix very well. Keep the heat to a low while adding coconut paste.  \nThen add the beaten curd and mix again.\nIf the gravy looks very thick, then you can add ¼ cup water. Mix well.\nSeason with salt. Do keep in mind that while cooking suran, some salt was added.\nBring the curry to a gentle boil or simmer on a low to medium-low heat. Once the curry comes to a gentle boil, then turn off the heat.\nMaking tempering :\nIn a tadka pan or a small frying pan, heat 1 tablespoon coconut oil. Keep the heat to a low and add ½ teaspoon mustard seeds.\nLet the mustard seeds crackle.\nThen add 1 to 2 red chilies (seeds removed) and 10 to 12 curry leaves. Fry till the red chilies change color. Do not burn them.\nNext add ¼ teaspoon methi seeds which have been slightly crushed in a mortar-pestle.\nMix and turn off the heat.\nPour the tempering mixture in the kalan curry.

Then soak the lentils for 4 hours or overnight.\nGrind or blend the soaked lentils to a smooth batter with water.\nIf the batter becomes watery, then the instant relief would be to add some semolina or urad dal flour or rice flour to it.\nAdd all the spices, herbs and salt. Mix well.\nTake a bowl of water. Apply some water from the bowl on both your palms. Take some batter in your right hand from the bowl. Give it a round shape by moving it around.\nWith your thumb make a hole in the center. You can also use banana leaves or zip lock bags to give the medu vada its doughnut shape.\nFrying Medu Vada :\nIn a kadai (wok) or pan heat oil for deep frying. Keep the heat to medium. \nOnce the oil becomes hot, slid the vada gently and carefully into the hot oil.\nShape the batter this way and gently slid them in the oil. Don't overcrowd the kadai or pan with the vada.\nOnce the vada is slightly golden then gently turn over with a slotted spoon and continue to fry.\nFry them till crisp and golden. The oil should be not very hot, but medium hot. You want the vadas to be cooked from inside. Very hot oil will quickly brown the vadas from outside but they will remain uncooked from inside. Less hot oil will make the medu vada to absorb too much oil. Even if the batter is thin then also the medu vadas will absorb too much oil.\nFry all the medu vada this way till they become evenly browned and crisp.\nDrain them on kitchen tissue to remove excess oil.\nServe the medhu vadai, hot or warm with sambar and coconut chutney. It can also be served with other dips like mint chutney, coriander chutney, tomato sauce or onion chutney, tomato chutney etc.\nOne of the best combination is sambar vada where these medu vadai are dunked in piping hot sambar and served with a side of coconut chutney.

It is also okay to use store bought ginger paste but fresh ginger tastes MUCH better.\nMake Pongal :\nUsing your hands, rinse the ½ cup (100 g) short grain rice and ¼ cup (65 g) split moong dal (hulled) to release the excess starches. Drain the cloudy water and repeat this process until the water is nearly clear while rinsing.\nIn an Instant pot, add rice, moong dal, 3 cups water, 1 teaspoon of the ghee, and 1 teaspoon sea salt and cook on high pressure setting for 12 minutes. Let the Instant Pot naturally vent for 10 minutes. We intentionally put a large amount of water so the rice and dal are easily mashable.\nOnce cooked, whisk the rice and dal so they meld into one. The consistency should be of a thick congee or polenta. If the pongal is too runny, keep the Instant Pot on saute mode until the excess water evaporates. if the pongal is too thick, add a bit of water to loosen the pongal.\nMake Topping and Tadka :\nIn a medium pan add remaining 6 tablespoons unsalted ghee and 20 raw cashews and sauté them on medium-low heat until the cashews become golden brown. Use a slotted spoon to remove and set aside the cashews while leaving the ghee behind in the pan.\nAdd 7 - 10 black peppercorn, 1 tablespoon freshly grated ginger, 2 teaspoons cumin seeds to the remaining ghee in the pan on medium heat. Cook until the raw smell of the ginger dissipates and the cumin seeds start dancing in the ghee.\nMake sure that there is enough ghee still in the pan. If not, add another tablespoon as needed. Add 10-15 curry leaves, to the hot pan with spices and wait for the curry leaves to sputter in the oil or impart their aromatic scent. Once the curry leaves sputter, turn off the heat. Add ¼ teaspoon asafetida to the spices.\nAssemble :\nPour tadka over the pongal and mix until thoroughly incorporated. Taste the pongal and add additional salt as required. \nTop pongal with cashews and enjoy on its own or with a side of sambar and coconut chutney.\nIf you tried this recipe, please consider leaving a comment and star rating below!

Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl and lightly pat it dry. Add the red chili powder, black pepper, salt, and baking soda and toss to coat chicken evenly. Stir in the egg. Lastly, add the cornstarch and all-purpose flour and toss to coat the chicken, adding the measured water if it gets clumpy or hard to mix.\nPreheat oil (See Note 4 for Air Frying instructions): Heat a large frying pan or heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Add oil so that it’s at least 1/2”/1.27 cm deep. It should be deep enough so that the batter doesn't stick to the bottom. Once the oil is hot, adjust heat level as needed to maintain medium-high heat (around 325-350°F/113-175°C).\nFry chicken: Gently lower each piece of chicken into the hot oil, making sure not to overcrowd the pan. (I like to use tongs to pick up the chicken and lower it into the oil.) Fry, turning often, until crispy and golden brown all over, 4-5 minutes. You want to maintain a medium-high temperature. Temp too low = chicken drying out. Temp too high = chicken still raw inside.\nRemove: \nUse a slotted spoon or spider strainer to transfer the chicken onto a wire cooling rack or paper-towel lined plate. Repeat with the remaining chicken.\nPrep food color water: \nPlace the water in a small measuring cup or bowl. Stir in the food coloring. Set aside.\nTarka: Gather Tarka ingredients along with water for deglazing the pan and set within reach. Heat oil in a large pan over medium heat. Once hot, add the cumin seeds, sliced garlic, green chili peppers, and whole dried chili peppers. Sauté, stirring constantly, for 2 minutes, until the garlic begins to brown. Deglaze with 2 tbsp water. Once the water dries up, add the garlic paste, ginger paste, and curry leaves and sauté until aromatic, another 2 minutes.\nAdd sauce: Add the chili garlic sauce, yogurt, and salt. Increase the heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Cook for 4-5 minutes, until the sauce thickens and reduces. You want to 'cook out' the raw flavor from the chili garlic. The longer you simmer, the more concentrated the flavor. Pour in the colored water and bring to a simmer again for another 2 minutes.\nSimmer together: Add the chicken and toss to coat. Taste and add salt, if needed. Simmer together for 1-2 minutes, until the sauce thickens. Serve hot as an appetizer or with basmati rice. I like to serve with lemon wedges on the side.","Total Cook Time":"45min","Prep Time":"15min","Cook Time":"30min","Setting Time":"60 min","Soaking Time":"No","Resting Time":"5min (after frying)","Serves":"4","Taste":"Spicy,Tangy","Color":"Deep red or orange","Course":"Lunch,Dinner","Meals":"NonVeg (Chicken)","Difficulties":"2","State":"South Indian","Video Link":"https://youtu.be/Sxqn0wPKsJM?si=RpPk1BuglXALPUCY","Cooking Type":"Regular(30 minutes)","Cuisine":"SouthIndian","Occasion":"Weddings","Drinks":"No","Sugar/SugarFree":"SugarFree","Category":"Chicken","RecipeName":"Chicken 65","ImagesSource":"https://www.teaforturmeric.com/chicken-65-restaurant-style/#ingredients","IngredientsSource":"https://www.teaforturmeric.com/chicken-65-restaurant-style/#ingredients","ProcessSource":"https://www.teaforturmeric.com/chicken-65-restaurant-style/#ingredients"}

Take rice and flattened rice in separate bowls. Take the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds in one bowl.\nRinse the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds a couple of times. Then soak them in 1 cup water for 4 to 5 hours.\nRinse the rice a couple of times and keep aside.\nRinse flattened rice once or twice and then add to the rice.\nPour 2 cups water. Stir and soak both rice and flattened rice together for 4 to 5 hours.\nMaking batter :\nBefore grinding, strain the water from the soaked lentils and keep it for grinding urad dal. \nAdd the lentils in the grinder jar. Also add ½ cup of the soaked and strained water to the dal. You can even use fresh water while grinding.\nGrind the urad dal, chana dal and fenugreek seeds till you get a batter which is light and fluffy. The urad dal has to be ground really well, so that the batter ferments well.\nRemove the batter in a bowl or pan with a spatula.\nStrain the rice well. Then in the same grinder, add the soaked rice and 1 cup fresh water. You can grind rice in one batch or in two to three batches. This will depend on the size of the grinder jar. To make the batter, I added 1 cup water. You can even add ¾ cup water while grinding. Addition of water will depend on the quality of rice.\nGrind the rice till you get a fine grainy consistency in it. The rice batter should have a fine rava (cream of wheat) like consistency. You can even grind to a smooth batter. \nNow pour the batter in the same pan or bowl containing the urad dal batter.\nAdd ½ teaspoon edible rock salt or add as per taste. You can also use sea salt or pink salt.\nMix the salt very well with the batter. Also mix both the batters very well. Cover and keep aside to ferment for 8 to 9 hours. You can keep batter to ferment for less or more time and this will depend on the temperature conditions in your city.\nPreparation for potato filling :\nFirst rinse and then boil 4 medium sized potatoes in 2 cups water for 5 to 6 whistles in a pressure cooker. You can also boil potatoes in a pan or in an Instant pot. The potatoes have to be completely cooked and fork tender.\nWhen the potaoes are cooking, soak the chana dal in hot water for 30 minutes. Then drain the chana dal and keep aside.\nWhen the pressure settles down on its own in the cooker, remove the lid. Drain the water from the potatoes and let them become warm. Then peel and chop them.\nAlso slice the onions thinly and chop the green chilies, ginger and coriander leaves.\nMaking potato filling :\nHeat oil or ghee in a frying pan or a skillet. Fry cashews and keep aside. This step of frying cashews is optional.\nLower the flame and add mustard seeds and let them splutter. Then add the chana dal.\nSaute the chana dal for 2 to 3 minutes on a low flame or till they turn light golden or golden. Now add the sliced onions, curry leaves, green chilies and ginger.\nSaute the onions stirring often till they soften and turn translucent.\nAdd the turmeric powder and asafoetida (hing). Mix very well.\nAdd water. Mix well and simmer for 2 to 3 minutes or till the mixture thickens a bit.\nNext add the boiled chopped potatoes and mix very well. You can also mash the potatoes if you like while cooking them.\nSeason with salt according to taste. Also add ¼ teaspoon sugar for a slight sweet taste.\nSimmer on a low flame for 3 to 4 minutes stirring occasionally. The water will reduce and the consistency will thicken. \nSwitch off the flame and then add chopped coriander leaves. Also add the fried cashews now and mix well. The potato filling should be moist and easily spreadable on the dosa. Make sure there is no water in the potato filling. It should not be of a curry or gravy consistency.\nStir and keep the potato filling aside.\nMaking masala dosa :\nLightly stir the batter, before you begin to make dosa.

You can spread the oil which was sprinkled earlier on the dosa with a spoon.

Cover with water and soak for a maximum of 20-25 minutes. \nPeel the onions, roughly chop them. Peel ginger and garlic and chop roughly. \nAdd black peppercorns and cloves to a mortar and pestle. Add 2-3 garlic cloves and pound. Make sure that each black peppercorn and clove is broken. Both these spices are a nuisance and chances are that they will otherwise remain whole even after cooking. \nFinely chop the onion, ginger, green chili, cilantro & mint leaves to be added to the ground kebab mixture.\nSoak the raisins(if using) in hot water for 8-10 minutes. Squeeze and keep ready. You could chop the raisins if you wish.\nCook the Meat, lentils and whole spices:\nAdd the lamb mince to pressure cooker. Add the drained soaked lentils along with all the whole spices. Also add the onions, ginger, garlic along with the pounded spices. Sprinkle salt. Add 1 to 1.25 cup water. Or add all the ingredients to steel insert of IP.\nUsing a wooden spoon, break the meat and mix together everything as much as you can. \nAt first keep the stove on medium, once you hear the first whistle, reduce the flame to low and let pressure cook for 15-18 minutes on low medium heat for 6-8 whistles. For IP, set it on high pressure and pressure cook for 10-12 minutes. Release pressure naturally. \nGrind the Kebab Mixture:\nCheck the meat and lentils for doneness. The lentils will hold shape but they would be completely soft and you would be able to mush them between thumb and fingers. (see image in post).Cook off the moisture by placing the pressure cooker on the stove (without closing the lid).\nLet the mixture cool down a bit (but don't let it get cold). Take out the bay leaves, cinnamon stick and black cardamom pods.Discard \nTransfer the warm mixture to a food processor jar fitted with metal blade. Process the meat for good 2-4 minutes until it resembles a smooth paste. Using a spatula, transfer the ground kebab mixture to a large bowl.\nMake the Kebab Mixture:\nAdd finely chopped onions, ginger, green herbs etc along with raisins to the ground kebab mixture. Using spatula at first, mix everything together. Taste and adjust salt. Taste and add more finely chopped green chillies if you want it more spicy. \nWith gentle hands, knead the kebab mixture similar to how we knead dough. Dont squish else the onions and herbs will start releasing water. Refrigerate and rest the kebab mixture for 30-40 minutes. Take a break! If you want, you can refrigerate overnight for best flavors and ease of shaping.\nShape The Shami Kebab:\nDivide the kebab mixture into portions. You could make them as large or small as you wish. I make them small(about 40-50g). For uniformity, measure out and weigh the portions using a food scale. \nIf needed, very lightly oil your hands. Take each portion and roll into a smooth ball. Flatten lightly on the palm to resemble a patty. Dont press too much. Don't make thin patties (else they will break). \nPan Fry The Kebab:\nTo pan fry, use a heavy pan (tawa/griddle used for making rotis or a cast iron tawa). You could use non-stick frying pan too. Place the pan on low medium heat and let heat up. \nTip- The temperature of pan plays a huge role in making sure that the shami kebab dont break. The tawa should not be too hot or too cold. To check the temperature of the pan, sprinkle some water on it, the water should steam immediately (the water should not sizzle or dance on the pan, that means that the pan is too hot). \nOnce the tawa is hot, add 2-3 drops of oil on the tawa and rub around. Dont add too much oil in the beginning else the kebabs start spreading.\n Place a few kebabs on the hot pan (without over crowding)keeping in mind that you have ample space around to flip them later without touching other kebabs.\n On medium heat, let the shami kebab fry. You have to allow a golden brown crust to form but the inside should remain soft. Once the kebab looks set, you may add 1-2 drops of oil all around it. \nUsing a flat large spatula (preferable sturdy metal) carefully flip the kebab and fry on other side until crust is formed. Right now the kebab is super soft, you will have to be careful. \nOnce the kebabs are fried on both sides, switch off the stove and let the kebabs stand on it for 4-5 minutes to set. Remove using a spatula. Serve with green chutney, onion slices, and lemon wedges. \n\n","Total Cook Time":"1 hour","Prep Time":"20 min","Cook Time":"40 min","Setting Time":"No","Soaking Time":"2 hours","Resting Time":"No","Serves":"4","Taste":"Spicy , delicious","Color":"Golden brown","Course":"Lunch, dinner","Meals":"NonVeg","Difficulties":"3 ","Cuisine":"Maharashtrian","Drinks":"No","Sugar/SugarFree":"SugarFree","VideoLink":"","Cooking Type":"Slow(1 hr)","State":"Maharshrta","Occasion":"Birthday, Wedding","Category":"Mutton","Images":"https://sinfullyspicy.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/3-2.jpg","ImagesSource":"https://sinfullyspicy.com/indian-shami-kebab-recipe-with-ground-lamb/","IngredientsSource":"https://sinfullyspicy.com/indian-shami-kebab-recipe-with-ground-lamb/","ProcessSource":"https://sinfullyspicy.com/indian-shami-kebab-recipe-with-ground-lamb/"}

Mix the dry ingredients well.\nAdd the khoya and curd (yogurt). Please use fresh yogurt. Instead of khoya you can also use milk powder.\nAdd water and begin to stir to a thick or medium-thick flowing batter without lumps.\nCover the bowl and allow the batter to rest for 30 minutes.\nMeanwhile when the batter is resting blanch the almonds and pistachios in hot water. Keep them soaked in hot water for 20 to 30 minutes. Then peel and slice them. Keep aside.\nMaking sugar syrup:\nIn a pan take sugar and water. Stir so that the sugar dissolves. On a low heat simmer this mixture.\nYou need to have a ½ string or 1 string consistency in the sugar syrup. If you cannot achieve these string consistencies than just make a sticky syrup.\nThe sugar needs to be kept warm. For this keep the sugar syrup on a hot water bath so that it stays warm throughout and does not crystallize.\nMeaning you have to keep the sugar syrup pan on a bowl or another pan filled with hot water. The hot water should touch the base of the pan containing the sugar syrup.\nMaking malpua:\nHeat ghee in a frying pan or skillet.\nWhen the ghee is heating up add baking soda to the batter.\nStir to combine so that the baking soda is mixed evenly with the batter.\nLower the heat. Take 2 to 3 tablespoons or a ladle of the batter and gently pour it on the hot ghee.\nSpread the batter lightly with the back of the spoon. Make 2 to 4 malpua depending on the size of the frying pan.\nFry on a low to medium heat. When one side is light golden and crisp, gently turnover and fry the second side until crisp and light golden.\nFry until both sides are golden flipping the malpua as needed for a couple of times.\nDrain them on paper towels to remove excess oil.\nCoating malpua with sugar syrup:\nThen immediately place them in the warm sugar syrup. Gently coat the malpua with the sugar syrup with a spoon or small tongs.\nImmediately remove them and place them in a serving tray or plate. Prepare all malpua this way and coat them with the sugar syrup.\nPour some rabri on top. Garnish with the chopped almonds and pistachios. Serve the malpua with rabdi hot.\nYou can also just serve them coated with the sugar syrup and garnished with the blanched nuts.\nMaking rabri to serve with malpua:\nIn a broad thick bottomed pan or sauce pan or a kadai take the whole milk and bring it first to boil.\nLower the heat and continue to simmer the milk stirring at intervals.\nBring the clotted cream/malai which forms on top of the milk to the sides of the pan. Also keep on scraping the dried milk from the sides and add them back to the milk.\nDo stir often so that the milk does not get burned at the bottom of the pan.\nKeep on simmering, stirring, removing the clotted cream and scraping the cream of the sides.\nSwitch off the heat when the milk has reduced to ⅓ or ¼ of its original volume. The milk would also have thickened. It will take about 45 minutes to 1 hour for the milk to thicken on a low heat.\nAdd sugar. Stir well so that the sugar dissolves.\nNext add crushed saffron or saffron powder along with kewra water (pandanus water) or rose water. Add the sliced almonds and pistachios.\nRemove the rabri in a bowl and serve it later with the malpua. Refrigerate if not using it immediately.\nThe combo of malpua rabdi taste good and is liked by many people. It is best and recommended to have malpua rabdi hot or warm.","Total Cook Time":"1 Hr","Prep Time":"5min","Cook Time":"25min","Setting Time":"No","Soaking Time":"No","Resting Time":"10min","Serves":"4","Taste":"Sweet","Color":"Golden Brown","Course":"AnyTime","Meals":"Veg","Difficulties":2,"State":"Odisha","Video Link":"","Sugar/SugarFree":"Sugar","Cooking Type":"Regular (30minutes)","Cuisine":"NorthIndian,Gujarati","Occasion":"Holi","Drinks":"No","Ingredients":"For Malpua Batter: \n      1) 1 Cup All-purpose Flour – 125 grams.\n      2) 1 Teaspoon Fennel Seeds – Kept Whole or Crushed.\n      3) 3 to 4 Green Cardamoms – Crushed or ⅓ Teaspoon Cardamom Powder.\n      4) 3 Pinches Baking Soda or ⅛ Teaspoon Baking Soda.\n      5) ½ Cup Water or Add as Required.\n      6) 3 Tablespoons Khoya (Mawa or Dried Evaporated Milk Solids) – 50 grams Khoya or 3 Tablespoons of Whole Milk Powder or Dairy Whitener.\n      7) 3 Tablespoons Curd (Yogurt).\n    \n    For Frying Malpua: \n      8) 4 Tablespoons Ghee (Clarified Butter) – For Frying.\n    \n    For Sugar Syrup: \n      9) ½ Cup Sugar.\n      10) ¼ Cup Water.\n    \n    For Rabdi: \n      11) 1.25 Litres Whole Milk or About 5 Cups.\n      12) 2.5 to 3 Tablespoons Sugar or Add as Required.\n      13) 5 to 6 Green Cardamoms – Crushed or ½ Teaspoon Cardamom Powder.\n      14) 2 Pinches Saffron Strands.\n      15) 1 Teaspoon Rose Water or Kewra Water (Pandanus Water).\n      16) 2 Tablespoons Almonds – Blanched and Sliced.\n      17) 2 Tablespoons Pistachios – Blanched and Sliced.","ImagesSource":"https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/malpua-recipe-malpua-rabdi/","IngredientsSource":"https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/malpua-recipe-malpua-rabdi/","ProcessSource":"https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/malpua-recipe-malpua-rabdi/"}

","Process":"Make sure that you’ve frozen the ice cream container for at least 24 hours before beginning.\nPrepare the vegan brownies first: you’ll want to make the brownies so that they’re cooling in time with the custard I recommend making the brownies first, then follow with the custard immediately afterwards. This will allow the brownies to fully cool before being churned into your ice cream, which will prevent the ice cream from melting. You can make these brownies gluten free or just regular vegan brownies. Once baked and cooled, slice half of the brownies into tiny cubes, and save the rest for serving with the ice cream. You can place the brownie bites into the freezer while you’re making the ice cream.\nMake the chocolate custard: in a medium saucepan on medium heat, whisk together all the ingredients. Continue whisking until the chocolate has completely melted into the oat milk. Remove the custard from the heat and allow the mixture to cool at room temperature for 10 minutes. Then transfer the custard to chill in the fridge for 2-3 hours. There should be no heat coming from the custard when you’re ready to make the ice cream. If there is, then you need to chill longer. Any heat will alter the temperature of the ice cream mixer, preventing the ice cream from actually forming.\nMake the ice cream: once your custard is chilled, follow the instructions of your ice cream machine, pouring the custard into the ice cream container and turning the machine on. With the specific ice cream maker I recommended, it took about 25 minutes to churn.\nStir in the brownie bites: add the brownie bites to the ice cream while it’s churning at or around 25-30 minutes in. Continue churning for another 5 minutes to ensure that the brownie is evenly distributed.\nOnce the ice cream has churned and thickened, transfer the ice cream to an ice cream storage container and store in the freezer. Scoop and serve as desired with the remaining brownies!","Category":"Dessert,icecream","ImagesSource":"https://thebananadiaries.com/easy-homemade-chocolate-brownie-ice-cream-vegan-gluten-free/","IngredientsSource":"https://thebananadiaries.com/easy-homemade-chocolate-brownie-ice-cream-vegan-gluten-free/","ProcessSource":"https://thebananadiaries.com/easy-homemade-chocolate-brownie-ice-cream-vegan-gluten-free/"}

Keep in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes. Note: You can also marinate the chicken overnight in teh refrigerator.\nSoak saffron in warm milk, reserve.\nRinse & Soak Rice:\nRinse and drain the basmati rice 2 to 3 times. Add 4 cups of water and let it soak for 20 minutes.\nFry Onions:\nWhile the rice is soaking, add ghee to a heavy-bottomed pan and add onions. On medium heat, fry the onions stirring frequently until they become light golden brown and start to crisp up - about 15 to 20 minutes.\nRemove the fried onions from the pan, leaving the excess ghee behind as we will use this pan to cook the chicken. Add one fourth of the fried onions to the marinated chicken and give a quick mix.\nParboil Rice:\nIn a medium pot add 8 cups of water. Add cumin seeds, bay leaves, star anise, cardamom, cloves, and salt to the rice and bring it to boil on high heat.\nDrain the soaked rice and add it to the boiling water. Bring the rice to a full boil on high heat. Lower the heat to medium and cook uncovered for 5 to 6 minutes or until the rice is about 90% cooked. Drain the rice promptly and reserve.\nCook chicken:\nTo the pan with the remaining ghee, add the marinated chicken. Cook on medium heat for 8 to 10 minutes, turning halfway through.\nLayer and cook Biryani on Dum:\nCarefully layer the partially cooked rice over the chicken. Top with caramelized onions and saffron-infused milk.\nCover the pot and seal it with aluminum foil, then place some weight over the lid. Cook on low heat for 20 minutes, this is the steam or \"Dum\" cooking step. Turn the heat off and wait another 10 minutes before opening the pot.\nGarnish with cilantro.

Form a well in the center of the flour, and slowly mix in 192 ml hot water and 15 grams neutral oil until a shaggy dough forms.\nKnead for 4 - 5 minutes until the dough is soft and quite smooth. Every so often, press your knuckles all over the dough to soften it while kneading. It should not be sticky or dry.\nNote: If you find the dough is tough or dry, you can add knead in a teaspoon of water at a time until it comes together. If the dough is sticky, knead in a teaspoon of atta flour at a time.\nLet the dough rest, covered in the bowl, for at least 20 minutes before rolling out.\nIf not using immediately, refrigerate in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 48 hours.\nAfter resting, the dough should feel quite soft and smooth.\nTo test this, take a small golf-ball sized portion of dough and roll into a ball. If you notice the balls are not soft and smooth (i.e. you see cracks/crevices), you can add a sprinkle of water at a time and knead the dough again until smooth. Let rest for another 15 minutes before using.\nRoll Out the Chapatis:\nDivide the dough into 12 golf ball-sized portions (about 40g) for smaller chapatis (6 - 7 inches) or 6 portions for larger chapatis (8 - 9 inches).\nKeep the dough balls covered while you roll out the chapatis.\nTake one ball of dough and press it down to form a thick disc, then dip in all-purpose flour on both sides.\nOn a wooden cutting board or work surface, roll out the chapati with a floured rolling pin until it's about 1/16-inch thick, dipping in flour as necessary to keep it from sticking to your work surface.\nTo keep it circular, alternate between rolling the dough out and rotating it 30 degrees every few seconds. The more evenly you roll out the dough, the more likely it will puff up.\nNote: The chapatis should be quite thin; if you pick them up, they should almost appear translucent.\nCook the Chapatis (Standard Way):\nSet a griddle pan, tawa, or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.\nWhen the pan just begins to smoke, add the chapati and cook for about 30 - 45 seconds until you see brown bubbles begin to form on the underside of the chapati (you can use a spatula or tongs to check).\nBrush the top (uncooked side) of the chapati with a bit of ghee, melted butter, or oil.\nNote: If the chapatis are charring too quickly, reduce the heat to medium.\nFlip the chapati, then brush the top side (the now cooked side) with ghee until the bottom cooks.\nFlip the chapati one last time until both sides are nicely browned, about 5-10 seconds.\nBrush the chapati once more with ghee. Wrap any finished chapatis in a kitchen towel to keep warm while you make the remaining rotis.\nRepeat the process of rolling out and cooking each chapati.\nNote: Reduce the heat to low any time the griddle is empty (otherwise the griddle can get too hot), and increase the heat back to medium-high while cooking each chapati.\nCook the Chapatis (Phulka, Puffed-Up Way):\nSet a griddle pan, tawa, or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat.\nWhen the pan just starts to smoke, add the chapati and let cook for about 30 seconds until you see brown bubbles begin to form on the underside of the chapati (you can use a spatula or tongs to check).\nFlip the chapati, then use a clean dish towel or paper towel to gently press down all around the outer edges of the chapati. The chapati should puff up nicely.\nAlternatively, if you have a gas stove, turn a separate burner on medium-low heat and carefully place the chapati directly on the flame until it puffs up.\nTurn the flame off, then transfer the chapati back to the griddle pan. Flip the chapati one last time until both sides are nicely browned.","Category":"","Cook Time":"20 min","Prep Time":"30 min","Resting Time":"No","Setting Time":"No","Soaking Time":"No","Total Cook Time":"50 min","Cooking Type":"Fast (10 minutes)","Sugar/SugarFree":"SugarFree","ImagesSource":"https://homecookingcollective.com/chapatis-indian-whole-wheat-flatbreads/","IngredientsSource":"https://homecookingcollective.com/chapatis-indian-whole-wheat-flatbreads/","ProcessSource":"https://homecookingcollective.com/chapatis-indian-whole-wheat-flatbreads/"}

You should have a little over 1 cup. Stirring occasionally, simmer the puree over medium-low heat until you’re left with 1/2 cup (about 135g) or slightly more (you need 1/2 cup for the cake). This takes at least 25–35 minutes, but could take longer depending on your pan or how juicy your strawberries were. Allow to cool completely before using in cake batter. I always make the reduced puree the day before so it has plenty of time to cool down. I cover and place in the refrigerator overnight. Allow it to come back to room temperature before adding to the cake batter. (See Notes for further make-ahead instructions.)\nPreheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans, line with parchment paper rounds, then grease the parchment paper. Parchment paper helps the cakes seamlessly release from the pans. (If it’s helpful, see this parchment paper rounds for cakes video & post.)\nMake the cake: Whisk the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt together. Set aside.\nUsing a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar together on high speed until smooth and creamed, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl with a silicone spatula as needed.\nBeat in the egg whites on high speed until combined, about 2 minutes. Then beat in the sour cream and vanilla extract. Scrape down the sides and up the bottom of the bowl as needed.\nWith the mixer on low speed, add the dry ingredients until just incorporated. With the mixer still running on low, slowly pour in the milk just until combined. Do not overmix.\nWhisk in 1/2 cup of room-temperature reduced strawberry puree, making sure there are no lumps at the bottom of the bowl. The batter will be slightly thick. Stir in food coloring, if desired. (I use 1 small drop of pink gel food coloring.)\nPour batter evenly into cake pans. Bake for around 24–25 minutes or until the cakes are baked through. To test for doneness, insert a toothpick into the center of the cake. If it comes out clean, it is done. Allow cakes to cool completely in the pans set on a wire rack. The cakes must be completely cool before frosting and assembling.\nMake the frosting: Using a blender or food processor, process the freeze-dried strawberries into a powdery crumb. You should have around 1/2 cup crumbs. Set aside. In a large bowl using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle or whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese for 1 minute on high speed until completely smooth and creamy. Beat in the butter until combined. Add the confectioners’ sugar, strawberry powder, 1 Tablespoon milk, and vanilla and beat on medium-high speed until combined and creamy. Add 1 more Tablespoon of milk to slightly thin out, if desired. Taste, then add a pinch of salt if needed. Yields about 3 cups of frosting.\nAssemble and frost: First, using a large serrated knife, slice a thin layer off the tops of the cakes to create a flat surface. Discard (or crumble over ice cream!). Place 1 cake layer on your cake stand, cake turntable, or serving plate. Evenly cover the top with frosting. Top with 2nd layer and spread the remaining frosting all over the top and sides. Refrigerate for at least 45 minutes before slicing. This helps the cake keep its shape when cutting—it could slightly fall apart without time in the fridge.\nCover leftover cake tightly and store in the refrigerator for 5 days.","Total Cook Time":"6hr","Prep Time":"1hr 30 min","Cook Time":"30 min","Setting Time":"No","Soaking Time":"No","Resting Time":"5-10 min","Serves":10,"Taste":"Sweet","Color":"Pink","Course":"Dessert","Meals":"Vegetarian","Difficulties":2,"State":"N/A","VideoLink":"","Cooking Type":"Slow (1hr)","Cuisine":"Western","Occasion":"Celebration, Summer","Drinks":"No","ImagesSource":"https://shreemsweetsandbakery.com/product/fresh-strawberry-cake/","IngredientsSource":"https://shreemsweetsandbakery.com/product/fresh-strawberry-cake/","ProcessSource":"https://shreemsweetsandbakery.com/product/fresh-strawberry-cake/"}

I use size 7 eggs.  \n8) ¾ cup (160 g) unflavoured vegetable oil - I use canola oil.  \n9) 2½ cups (566 g) canned crushed pineapple - in pineapple juice (not syrup - see note 5). 20 oz can in the US.  \n10) 1 tsp vanilla essence/extract.  \n11) 1½ tbsp (20 g) fresh lemon juice.  \n\nPineapple Cake Filling:  \n1) ¾ cup (170 g) canned crushed pineapple - in pineapple juice (not syrup - see note 5).  \n2) ¼ cup (50 g) white granulated sugar.  \n3) ¼ cup (25 g) cornstarch.  \n4) ¾ cup (175 g) milk - full fat.  \n5) 1 tbsp (15 g) fresh lemon juice.  \n6) ¼ cup (56 g) unsalted butter - cold and cut into cubes.  \n7) 1 drop yellow gel food colour - OPTIONAL (see note 4).  \n\nPineapple Whipped Cream Frosting: \n1) 1 cup (225 g) mascarpone - cold. See note 1 if you don't want to use mascarpone.  \n2) ½ cup (55 g) icing sugar - also known as powdered sugar or confectioners sugar.  \n3) 1 tsp vanilla essence/extract.  \n4) 1½ cups (335 g) whipping cream - cold, minimum fat percentage of 34%.  \n5) ½ cup (112 g) canned crushed pineapple - with the excess pineapple juice removed (see note 2).  \n","Process":"Pineapple Cake:\nPreheat oven to 160°C (320°F) with the fan on (see note 3 if you don't have a fan function) and grease two 8-inch cake tins (I use my homemade cake release). Also, line the bottom as this cake is prone to sticking to the bottom of the cake tin.\nSift together the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Using a whisk or fork, mix until well combined. Set aside for now.\nIn a large bowl, combine the white sugar, eggs, vegetable oil, crushed pineapple, vanilla, and lemon juice. Using a whisk, mix until well combined and no lumps remain.\nAdd the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, and using a spatula, gently fold until just combined. Do not overmix.\nEvenly distribute the batter into the two cake tins. Drop the cake tins lightly on the counter to remove any large air bubbles and bake for 30–33 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean.\nOnce baked, allow them to cool in the cake tins for about 20 minutes, then turn them out onto a wire rack to completely cool before frosting.\nPineapple Cake Filling:\nWhile the cake is baking, make the pineapple filling. In a saucepan, combine crushed pineapple, white sugar, cornstarch, milk, and lemon juice. Mix everything well, then place it over medium heat, continuously mixing until it thickens. It may look like the filling is curdling as it heats up, but don't worry; it will come together once the cornstarch activates.\nOnce thick, take it off the heat immediately and add the butter and gel color (if you're using it). Stir until the butter is completely melted and incorporated. Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool.\nPineapple Whipped Cream Frosting:\nPrepare the whipped cream once everything is cool and the cake is ready to assemble. Before beginning, ensure your mascarpone and whipped cream are cold.\nIn a large bowl, combine the mascarpone, icing sugar, and vanilla. Mix on a low speed for about 10 seconds, then turn up the speed to medium-high and mix until well combined. If using a stand mixer, use the whisk attachment.\nAdd the whipping cream and mix on a low speed for about 10 seconds (to allow everything to combine without splattering), then turn up the speed to medium-high and whip until stiff peaks form. Keep a careful eye on the mixture as you don't want to overwhip the cream.\nTo finish, add the crushed pineapple and, using a spatula, gently fold it in until just combined. The frosting is now ready to use.","Total Cook Time":"1 hr 60 min","Prep Time":"25 min","Cook Time":"30-35 min","Setting Time":"No","Soaking Time":"No","Resting Time":"No","Serves":12,"Taste":"Sweet and Tangy","Color":"Golden Brown","Course":"Dessert","Meals":"Vegetarian","Difficulties":2,"State":"   \n\tEast Asia","VideoLink":"","Cooking Type":"slow (1 hr) )","Cuisine":"Taiwan","Occasion":"Birthday, Celebration","Drinks":"No","Sugar/SugarFree":"Sugar","ImagesSource":"https://www.dreamadozen.com/products/pineapple-cake?_pos=1&_sid=db4eb57f0&_ss=r","IngredientsSource":"https://cakesbymk.com/recipe/the-best-pineapple-cake/","ProcessSource":"https://cakesbymk.com/recipe/the-best-pineapple-cake/"}

Add water in parts and begin to knead. I added ¾ cup water. Depending on the quality of flour, you can add ¾ to 1 cup water. Knead to a smooth and soft dough. Cover the dough and set aside the dough to rest. Make Stuffing: In a mortar-pestle, take ½ teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera) and ½ teaspoon fennel seeds (saunf). Lightly crush and keep aside. Take 1 cup roasted gram flour or roasted black chickpea flour (sattu) in a mixing bowl or pan. Add the crushed cumin seeds and fennel seeds. Now, add ½ teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain), ½ teaspoon nigella seeds (kalonji) and ½ teaspoon red chili powder. Next, add 1 to 2 teaspoons chopped green chilies, 1 teaspoon finely chopped ginger and 1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic. Add 2 tablespoons chopped coriander leaves, ¼ teaspoon black salt and regular salt as per taste. Add 2 teaspoons lemon juice. Next, add 2 teaspoons mustard oil. Mix very well. Sprinkle 1 to 2 tablespoons water all over and mix the flour with water evenly. Add more water, if required. The stuffing mixture should not be too dry or too wet. If the mixture is dry, then the dryness is felt while eating Littis. Assemble, Shape and Make Litti: After the dough has rested for 30 minutes, make small or medium sized balls from the dough. First method – sprinkling little flour, roll each dough ball to a circle of about 5 to 6 inches. Place 2 to 3 tablespoons of the stuffing in the center. Pleat and join the edges. Press the joined part and lightly roll the stuffed dough balls in your palms, so as to get a round shape. Keep aside. Second method – flatten the dough ball with your palms and make a shallow cup. Now, place the stuffing. Gently bring together the outer dough cover in the center, while pressing the stuffing. Join and seal the edges. Here is the prepared litti with the second method. Keep the prepared Littis under a cotton towel or napkin, so that the dough does not dry out. Bake Litti: Place the prepared Littis on a baking tray, which has been greased with some oil. Grease baking tray well, otherwise the Littis can stick to the tray. After 10 to 15 minutes, remove the tray and flip each Litti. Keep the tray back in the oven. Again after 10 to 15 minutes, remove the tray and flip each Litti. Place the tray back in the oven. You will have to do this once or twice more, for even baking. Bake for a total of about 30 to 35 minutes till the crust looks done with some light brown or golden brown spots on them. Timing will vary upon the size and capacity of the oven. It took me about 40 minutes. Brush them all over with some melted ghee. This step is optional and only to get charred spots on the Litti. Secure it in a pair of tongs and place on fire. Rotate for a few seconds till you see some charred spots on it. Serve the Bihari style Litti with a chokha of your choice accompanied with a small bowl of melted ghee. The litti is broken, dipped in ghee and then eaten with the chokha. You can also sprinkle some ghee on the Litti and then eat them.","ProcessSourse":"https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/","Total Cook Time":"1hr 45mins","Prep Time":"1hr","Cook Time":"45 mins","Serves":"4","Taste":"Savory, Spicy, Cheesy","Color":"Golden brown","Course":"Lunch,Dinner","Meals":"Veg","Difficulties":"2","State":"Bihar","Videolink":"https://youtube.com/watch?v=iFY-vVub7Kc","Videolinksourse":"https://www.vegrecipesofindia.com/","Cooking Type":"2","Cuisine":"North Indian","Occasion":"Holi,Diwali,Weddings","Drinks":"No","Sugar/SugarFree":"SugarFree","RecipeName":"Litti Chokha","Ingredients":"For litti dough: 1) 2 cups whole wheat flour (atta) or 240 grams whole wheat flour. 2) ¼ teaspoon salt. 3) 1 tablespoon Ghee or oil.

(Note: Soaking is optional. If you don't have time, feel free to skip this part). Add soaked toor dal along with water, roughly chopped tomatoes, a pinch of turmeric, 1-inch ginger, and a tsp of oil in a stainless steel container. Pressure cook for 15 mins on a medium flame. Mash the cooked dal using a wooden mathu/churner or the back of a ladle. Keep the mashed dal container with enough water and add the required salt on a medium flame. Let it boil for 5 mins or until the froth appears on top. Turn off the flame once it is done. Take a small pan and keep it on a medium flame. Pour coconut oil; once it is hot, add mustard seeds and allow them to splutter. Add cumin seeds and red chili. Saute for 30 seconds. Add crushed ginger and curry leaves. Add hing/asafoetida and fry for 15 seconds. Then switch off the flame. Carefully pour the seasoning into the bele saaru. Add some chopped cilantro/coriander leaves and squeeze half a lemon for the flavor. Here you go...
